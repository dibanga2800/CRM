        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>I started having passion for programming when i was 18, so i studied computer engineering in my first degree, so that gave me the foundation and started learning different programming languages. Because of my passion for programming i make
          sure i aced all my programming courses with distinction. But unfortunately for me when i graduated from the university, i got my first job as a network engineer which i worked for 4 years. Since i couldn't giveup my passion so easily, i
          decided to take up a masters degree in computing where i studied at De Montfort university, Leicester and graduated with a distinction. At this time am very much prepared to take up my career in programming. I have gain wealth of experience
          in designing web and mobile applications, am open to any opportunity to begin this great journey</p>
